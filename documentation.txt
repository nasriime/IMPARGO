Task1:(commit task1)
      - Segements splitted by days cy locations which have the same day.
      -	I had a better solution for this if we add from the backend ID to the trip,
	we could make segemnts of locations share the same trip ID.

Task2:(commit task2)
      - Send day and hour to search for matching with that day and hour 
        and bind markers to map.
      - Search is restricted to the past 30 days but of course this can be changed 
        or even add calender to make it nice.
      - Reset button added to wipe markers from the map and search again.
      - If you want to see results, please match days and hours from the file 
        tracking.json, for example ( day 2019-07-23 / hour 18:00)
